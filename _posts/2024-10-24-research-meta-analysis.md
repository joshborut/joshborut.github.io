Never before has this quote held more truth. After finding a journal article about the application of AI for renewable energy with notable conflicts of interest that I thought would be __the one__, I realized that the paper was not much so much a study as much a design scheme for the neural network model. With that, I dove back into the sea of journal articles--courtesy of the *Horace Mann Katz Library*--until I stumbled across an *alluring* (pun intended) paper on the effectivity of fishing hooks. With that, I cast my meta-analysis rod and started reeling in the data (last pun...maybe).

# 1. Hypotheses
[Hook Types Influence The Catch Effectiveness, Injuries, and Survival Rates of Fishes in Recreational Fishing](https://research-ebsco-com.horacemann.idm.oclc.org/c/qideok/viewer/pdf/n2ua7c4iav) is an experimental study that investigates the optimal hooks for catch and release fishing to prevent fish injuries and mortality. 

Although the null hypothesis is not *explicitly* stated, it is that <mark>there is no statistically significant relationship between __fish survival rates__ and the __types of hook__ used to catch them</mark>. The alternative hypothesis is that <mark>both __circle hooks__ and __octopus hooks__ impact fish survival rates, with __octopus hooks__ resulting in a higher likelihood of survival</mark>. In addition, the authors draw other conclusions with respect to hook effectivity. Nonetheless, this alternative hypothesis is the main focus. 

# 2. Who were the Collectors and Analysts?
The *big fish* in this paper are Lirong Yu Abit and Dr. Wan Zabidii Wan Morni. Lirong Yu Abit is an experienced researcher at the Curtin University Sarawak in Malaysia with a masters degree in science, specifically in aquatic biology. Dr. Wan Zabidii Wan Morni is a lecturer at __Universiti Putra Malaysia Bintulu Sarawak Campus__ who specializes in the field of crustacean immunology. He is also affiliated with the __International Institute of Aquaculture and Aquatic Sciences in Malaysia__. The other two coauthors Siti Nur Sahwati Rusdi and Nicole Lee Siao Yen are presumably students from the Department of Animal Science and Fisheries at the __Universiti Putra Malaysia Bintulu__. None of the authors reported any conflict of interest, nor could I find any. Additionally, I could not find much online about the main journal *Malaysian Applied Biology* where this paper was published, however, I discovered that it is run by __National University of Malaysia__, suggesting that it is the real deal. Given the experience of the overseeing authors and the university behind the journal where the article was published, we can likely trust the paper.

# 3. What's the Deal with the Dataset?
The paper references studies including [Effect of Hook Type on Mortality, Trauma, and Capture Efficiency of Wild Stream Trout Caught by Angling with Spinners](https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1577/M02-171.1) and [Influence of artificial lure hook type on hooking characteristics, handling, and injury of angled freshwater gamefish](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783621001843?via%3Dihub), however, their respective datasets were not used. The main data referred to was collected by the researchers. The paper includes the following diagram with an overview of the dataset, but there is no way to access the dataset itself. The use of `PAST software version 4.0`, a platform for statistical analysis in the field of paleontology, is also mentioned, but there is no way to access the relevant data there either. Unfortunately, this means that the analysis is not fully replicable. The experiment, on the other hand, is replicable as the methodology is provided in detail.

# 4. Why this Data?

As the authors put it, "the results obtained from this study will he a useful baseline for recreational anglers, for improved [catch and release] practices in Malaysia, especially in Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo)." The authors emphasize the growing popularity of fishing and consequently the relevance of this study. Beyond seeking to reduce fish mortality, the authors use the data to suggest methods to optimize fish yield.

# 5. What Data Is Left In? What Data Is Left Out?
![Fishing location](/assets/img/fish_map.png)

The researches collected data by visiting the recreational fishing pond on Universiti Putra Malaysia Bintulu Sarawak Campus shown in the above map. Experimenters used the same rod setup and changed the independent variable of the hook type between (A) an octopus hook and (B) a circle hook (illustrated below).

Immediately after the fish were captured, the researchers removed the hooks on a tray with a consistent technique and observed if the location of the hook penetration was __critical__ or __non-critical__. Fish were also sorted by species and kept in individual "quarantine tanks" for 24 hours to observe their health before being released. 

The data collection process in this study is quite thorough. There is not much left out that is relevant to the alternative hypothesis the researchers are investigating. *So far, the paper is quite promising!*

# 6. Evidence
Here is where things start to fall apart a bit. The authors claim from the data that __octopus hooks__ are better for catch and release because they result in less injuries and mortality, in contrast to a previous American study which concluded that there is no difference between __octopus hooks__ and __circle hooks__ in terms of survival rate. The researchers concede that the bait used played a role in the fish attracted, but they fail to recognize the full degree to which the injuries sustained could have been a result of the hook extraction method. Moreover, they draw broad conclusions about hook usage for all fish even though the majority of fish caught were Tilapia. Futhermore, a disproportionate number of fish were caught using __circle hooks__ (41) compared to __octopus hooks__ (22), but the authors address this disparity. This study would be more convincing if it included a __control group__ of fish captured with nets as a point of comparison to show if fish mortality after the 24-hour observation period was from hook injuries or stress from capture and captivity.

# 7. Funding Nemo
Funding came from the __Ministry of Food Industry, Commodity  and Regional  Development  Sarawak__, a Malaysian governmental agency. Additionally, the __Universiti Putra Malaysia Bintulu__ provided the facilities to conduct research. Given the source of funding, it makes sense why the authors investigating fishing practices for such a specific region in Malaysia.

# 8. To *publish* or *perish*? That is the question.

As with most studies, there is a risk of *publish* or *perish*. This phrase refers to the pressure to publish and manipulate research, even if the results do not suggest a stastically, due to financial or reputational pressures. Considering that this study was government subsidized, the researchers likely had increased pressure to publish their findings to spur recreational fishing in the region. However, the fact that the authors reference an aforementioned paper which failed to report a statistically significant relationship between hook type and survival rate suggest that papers in this domain are still published regardless of whether the alternative hypothesis is shown.
